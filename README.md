# Portfolio Layout

## Header

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using React-Spring, the text flows left to right with an initial welcome message. This welcome message does not repeat itself like the other "Flying Text" objects. 

## Navbar

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Bootstrap's navigation presets, I was able to make a mobile-first designed navbar. Within REACT, the nav links will bring the page to separate url/page links that are read through a switch statement using window.location.pagename. This removes the need to include multiple HTML Documents on the hosted site.

## Content

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My approach to displaying the content on each page is essentially giving my elevator pitch on my home page, projects, resume, and an about section containing a personal bio.
